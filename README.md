# 🛡️ Fraud Detection System (Low-Code / No-Code)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **end-to-end Fraud Detection System** built using **Microsoft low-code tools**.  
It detects, tracks, and analyzes potentially fraudulent SMS and Email communications using **rule-based logic, automation, and data visualization**.

The system demonstrates how **Excel, SharePoint, Power Automate, Microsoft Forms, and Power BI** can be combined to build a real-world fraud monitoring solution **without traditional programming**.

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- **Microsoft Forms** – User submission of suspicious messages  
- **SharePoint** – Centralized data storage  
- **Power Automate** – Automated workflows & fraud classification  
- **Microsoft Excel** – Rule logic & data preprocessing  
- **Power BI** – Interactive fraud analytics dashboard  

---

## 🔄 System Workflow
1. User submits a suspicious SMS or Email via **Microsoft Forms**
2. Data is stored in a **SharePoint List**
3. **Power Automate**:
   - Validates the submission  
   - Applies fraud detection rules  
   - Flags records as *Fraud* or *Safe*
4. Data is processed in **Excel**
5. **Power BI** visualizes fraud insights in real time

---

## ⚙️ Fraud Detection Logic
The system uses **rule-based detection**, including:
- High-risk sender email domains
- Suspicious message codes
- Repeated submissions from the same sender
- Abnormal activity frequency
- User feedback ratings

> Rules are configurable and can be enhanced without changing system architecture.
